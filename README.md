dotfiles
========

This is an attempt to gather the useful parts of configurations files scattered around the computers I use.

Should you find anything useful: copy it!
Should you find any errors: please tell me!

To install, clone the repository and create symbolic links to the files you need. Take care not to overwrite any existing files you might have.
Stuff you only want on one machine can be put into .extra

    cd
    ln -s Projects/dotfiles/.profile .profile
    ln -s Projects/dotfiles/.aliases .aliases
    ln -s Projects/dotfiles/.bash_prompt .bash_prompt
